# bike-store-customer-segmentation
This project looks at customer data from an Australian bike store and groups customers into meaningful segments. The goal is to help the business understand who their customers are, how they shop, and how to tailor marketing or retention strategies for each group.

I used SQL to clean and join the raw tables, Python for preprocessing and K-Means clustering, and Tableau to build an interactive dashboard for exploring the results.
